# Pokedex

A very simple example of PokeAPI app.

## Pre-requisites

To build and run the project you must have Xcode 11.4.1 or newer (and swift-tools-version 5.1 at least).

## Approach

I have decided to take the opportunity to start enjoying SwiftUI and Combine frameworks (MVVM design). Contributions are welcome!
Also, this project take the advantage of Swift Package Manager.

## Packages

This project relies on the following Swift Packages, all from my authorship:

- https://github.com/persiogv/PokeClient
- https://github.com/persiogv/CoreNetworking
- https://github.com/persiogv/CoreSwiftUI
- https://github.com/persiogv/Core
- https://github.com/persiogv/CoreUITests

## Favorites

As PokeAPI doesn't have endpoints to handle favorited pokemons, this is just a fake feature, caching the favorites only in the memory.
